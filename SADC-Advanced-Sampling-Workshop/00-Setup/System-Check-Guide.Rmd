# Why run a final check?

# A Pre-Flight Check for Your R Environment ✈️

You have installed R, RStudio, and all the necessary packages. Excellent!

--

This final script is a quick, automated check to **verify** that everything is working together correctly before we begin the workshop.

--

It confirms that your system is <span class=highlight>100% ready for Day 1</span>.

---

# What Does the Script Check?

The script quickly verifies three key components:

1.  **R & RStudio Versions:** Confirms the core software is running.

--

2.  **`tidyverse` Package:** Ensures the main toolkit for data manipulation is available.

--

3.  **`survey` Package:** Confirms the most critical toolkit for our workshop is ready to go.
