# First, what is an R Package?

# Think of Packages as Toolkits ðŸ§°

.pull-left[
- By default, R is powerful, but it comes with a basic set of tools.

- **Packages** are community-created add-ons that provide specialized functions for specific tasks.

- We must install these "toolkits" before we can use them in our workshop.

### Our Workshop Analogy:
- **R** is your new, empty workshop.
- **Packages** are your toolkits:
  - `survey` (for complex sampling)
  - `tidyverse` (for data carpentry)
  - `sf` (for map-making)
]

# The Key Packages We Need

The script we will run installs several crucial packages, including:

- `tidyverse`: For powerful data manipulation (`dplyr`) and visualization (`ggplot2`).

- `survey`: The <span class=highlight>most important</span> package in R for complex survey analysis.

- `sf`: For working with modern spatial data (maps and GIS).

- `readxl`: For importing data directly from Excel files.

- `xaringan`: The package used to create these very slides!

# How to Install Everything at Once
### Using the script I've prepared for you.

# Step 1: Find the Script ðŸ“‚

In the RStudio **Files** pane (usually bottom-right):

1.  Make sure you are in the `00-Setup` folder.

2.  You will see a file named `Package-Requirements.R`.
