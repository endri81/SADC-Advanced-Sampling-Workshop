## 1. Workshop Overview

[cite_start]This repository contains all training materials for the **Regional Training Workshop on Advanced Sampling Methods for Household Surveys**, delivered as part of the SADC Regional Statistics Project[cite: 29, 31]. [cite_start]This consultancy aims to conclude with the delivery of the workshop to SADC Member States[cite: 21]. [cite_start]The workshop is designed to strengthen the technical capacity of professionals in advanced sampling methods[cite: 38].

[cite_start]The training emphasizes a balance between rigorous statistical theory and practical, hands-on application using real-world data scenarios and case studies[cite: 70, 72].

## 2. Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this workshop, participants will be able to:

-   [cite_start]Design and implement complex, multi-stage sampling frameworks for various household surveys, such as Labor Market or demographic surveys[cite: 47, 48].
-   [cite_start]Apply stratified and cluster sampling techniques to improve survey efficiency and precision[cite: 48].
-   [cite_start]Develop and apply advanced weighting schemes, including post-stratification and calibration methods[cite: 58, 138].
-   [cite_start]Integrate GIS tools for the development of modern spatial sampling frames[cite: 58, 170].
-   [cite_start]Implement robust quality assurance protocols and error mitigation strategies in survey operations[cite: 58, 170].
-   [cite_start]Utilize statistical software (specifically R, Python, and STATA) for complex survey design and analysis[cite: 80, 134].

## 3. Repository Structure

The materials are organized by day, with each daily module containing slides, scripts, data, and practical exercises.
